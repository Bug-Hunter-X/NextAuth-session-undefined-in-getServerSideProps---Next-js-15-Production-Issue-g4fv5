# NextAuth Session Issue in Next.js 15 Production

This repository demonstrates a bug where NextAuth session data is unavailable in `getServerSideProps` within a Next.js 15 application deployed to production.  The issue does not reproduce in the development environment.

## Problem

The `session` object returned by `unstable_getServerSession` is consistently undefined when accessing a protected route in production, despite successful authentication.  The application functions correctly in development, leading to a production-only failure.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (NEXTAUTH_URL, etc.) according to NextAuth documentation.
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (works as expected)
5. Build and deploy the application to your production environment (session breaks)

## Solution (aboutSolution.js)

The solution involves using a different approach to retrieve the session.  This particular issue may be related to how the session is stored or handled during the production build. By making adjustments to the session handling we can ensure that the session is available consistently in `getServerSideProps` across environments.
